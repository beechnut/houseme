Okay. What are the parts I need to have in order?
  TDD the results model. I need:
    Result:
      Title, Price, Bedrooms, Post URL, Poster Email Address
      belongs to housing preference, user through housing preference
  How results are retrieved. Crawler. Okay.
  How results are sent. How do I send an email to each person, with custom data?


neighborhood: gbs

HOUSING
  apts / housing { :housing_type = "apartment" }
  rooms / shared { :housing_type = "room" }
  sublets / temporary { :housing_type = "room" }

results div: blockquote#toc_rows
  individual result: p.row  # datapid="listing id"
    post link: span.pl, a[href]
    post title: span.pl, children(text)
      price & br: span.itempnr children(text)
      price & br: match ($..../..br)


to get all cities:

every month, crawl craigslist for new us cities, email admin if there's something new
