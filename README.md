HouseMe

*Limited to the Boston area only at the moment. We plan to offer more cities in the future.*

Sign up for HouseMe and tell us your housing preferences.  

We'll crawl the web for you, looking for housing on a number of major housing websites. If we've found new housing posts that match what you're looking for, we'll send you an email and/or text alert.

### Housing websites

+ Harvard grad student housing (not actually limited to Harvard grad students)
